# GATE CoreNLP Server plugin 

This is a plugin for the GATE NLP fraemwork that annotates documents based on a
CoreNLP server (see http://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/corenlp-server.html).

NOTE: this does not support the CoreNLP parser and co-referencer yet. Tokenization, sentence splitting, pos tagging, 
finding the lemma and NER are supported. 

[More information can be found in the wiki](https://github.com/GateNLP/gateplugin-Tagger_CoreNLP/wiki).
